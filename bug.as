The following ActionScript code attempts to access a property of an object before checking if the object itself exists or if the property is available. This can lead to a runtime error (usually a TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference).  This is especially common when dealing with dynamically loaded data or events that might not always provide the expected object structure.

```actionscript
// Example: Attempting to access a property before checking for null

var myObject:Object = someFunctionThatMightReturnNull();
var myValue:String = myObject.someProperty;
// Use myValue
```
