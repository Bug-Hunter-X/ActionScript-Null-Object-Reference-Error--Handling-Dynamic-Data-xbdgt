# ActionScript Null Object Reference Error: Handling Dynamic Data

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: accessing properties of an object before verifying that the object itself exists and the property is available.  Failure to perform these checks can result in a runtime `TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference`.

The `bug.as` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version that includes null checks to prevent the error.

This is particularly important when dealing with asynchronous operations, network responses, or any situation where the existence of an object or property isn't guaranteed.
