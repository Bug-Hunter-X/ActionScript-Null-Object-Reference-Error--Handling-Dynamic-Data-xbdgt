The solution involves adding null checks before accessing properties.  This ensures that the code doesn't attempt to access properties of a `null` object.

```actionscript
// Solution: Adding null checks before accessing properties

var myObject:Object = someFunctionThatMightReturnNull();
var myValue:String = null;

if (myObject != null && myObject.hasOwnProperty("someProperty")) {
  myValue = myObject.someProperty;
}
// Use myValue (it might be null if the property wasn't found)

//Alternative using a conditional operator
var myValue:String = myObject != null && myObject.hasOwnProperty("someProperty") ? myObject.someProperty : null; // safer
//Use myValue
```
This corrected code first verifies that `myObject` is not `null` and that the `someProperty` exists using `hasOwnProperty()` before attempting to access it.  If either condition is false, `myValue` remains `null`, preventing the runtime error.  The alternative solution using a conditional operator is more compact and concise.
